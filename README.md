# Multiclass-Classifiaction-
The proposed paper uses a computer vision-based approach to perform the task. With the help of the presented technique, the autonomous vehicle can adjust its speed to stabilize the motion. The proposed model aims to support ADAS. The features of a flyover, bridge, slope, and surface are extracted using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM). Texture characteristics based on GLCM are retrieved from each of the four classes and sent into the LightGBM Classifier, which is utilized for classification. The proposed approach resulted in 98 % accuracy.
